# This is for Git/ Github and the ACP process.

The ACP process is essential when making sure you keep up with all the commits from terminal to guthub.

First you'll need to move your file from Github to your terminal using **git clone "insert linke from website"**

Once on your laptop's shell/ terminal you can open VSCODE to help with syntax.

**A:** git add * :Adding a flie e.t.c. to the link.

**C:** git commit -a : To commit all change in the terminal.

**P:** Git push origin master : Final push to move all the new files from the laptop back to Github.

You can use **git status** to check up on how many commits you are behind from the terminal to Github.
