# React: Components Lifestyle Events

React lets you define components as classes or functions. <!-- Joshua Blankenship -->

They can also be referred to as lifecycle events, from methods.

These method will be able to be called during any lifecycle of a component, and they can also update the UI application states.

Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting are the three phases of the component lifecycle. <!-- Joshua Blankenship -->

When an instance of a component is being appended to the DOM element refers to the MOUNTING PHASE.

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
  
  -The redner.

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

  -The very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is the constructor.

3. What does componentDidMount do?

  -ComponentDIDMount appends the element to the DOM.

4. What types of things can you pass in the props?

  -Data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.

5. What is the big difference between props and state?

  -Props you pass into a component also must be updated outside of the component and State are handeled inside of a component

6. When do we re-render our application?

  -You re-render the application when the user invokes something inside of a state.

7. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

  -You can use a state inside of a form so you can store the value inside of the component.

## Things I wanted to learn more about

One thing I wanted to learn more about would be the ways that the state can store data locally on ones computer or any other ways.
