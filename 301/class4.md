# Class Reading 04

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

-Something that renders a form and and controls that data by keeping the form date inside of the components state.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

-Wait until they input their data, So you can check to see if the data is correct and works with whatever software their using.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- Creating a function to handle the click Event that we're targeting? {event.target.value}

# Ternary Operator
Why would we use a ternary operator?

-To shorten your code and replace an if statement.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

- x===y ? console.log(true): console.log(false);

## Things I want to know more about
 
Didn't go too deep into this reading, still getting caught up on last reading. But everything for this reading made sense, I don't have anything extra I would like to learn about.
