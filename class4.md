# Structuring Web Pages with HTML (CODE 102 Read 04)

**Wireframe**: A common practice used by UX designers to plan a information class for a website e.t.c. A sketch of a design for a website e.t.c.

Two types of wireframes:
Hand Drawn Wireframe
Digital Wireframe

**Wireframing**: Is used either by drwaing by hand or other apps or tools designed.

Some of the best tools for wireframing are UXPins, InVision and Wireframe.cc

The three key principles for a good wireframe are Clarity, confidence and simplicity. 

**HTML**: Is a markup language that defines the  stucture of your content.

This is how you start a paragraph "< P >" without the spaces.
And to end a paragraph you use < /p >  without the spaces.

Nesting in **HTML** is the best way to make something bold.

Example: < P > The cat is very < strong > mad </ strong > at times < /p > without the spaces in between the <>.

Inserting Images in HTML can be done with this code                                                       < img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" > without the spacing inside.

Headings in HTML can be used like < h1 > Hello < /h1 > withouth the spacing also. This goes as follows all the way up to 6.

Inserting a link would go as follows < a href="https://example.com">Website< /a > without any of the spaces included into the synyax.

**Semantics** is the meaning of the code and what it does rather than what it'll look like.
