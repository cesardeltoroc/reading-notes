## Text

The head has 6 levels and the higher in number the headers go the smaller the words become.

A paragraph is enclosed by < p>  This would be a paragraph inside of these tags.< p >

To bold a word simply use **< b >Word< /b >**

To italicize a word simple use ***< i> Word< /i >***

Visual editors can be used to help get a presenataion of how ones code can look.

< strong > between words means the word/ sentence has a meaning and will be bold < /strong>

To quote cite something using a web link you can use the following 
< blockquote cite="LINK">
< P> The food was tasty and I didn't wanna stop eating.< /p>
< /blockquote>

To quote something without using the "" you can use < q> </ q> tags.

To abbrivate an accronym you can use < acronym title="Fast Pizza Place"> Pizza</ acronym>

The < s> < /s> will let you mark a line through information that is not longer valid but you would still like to keep because it may have an importance in the future.

## Introducing CSS

Cascade Style Sheets allow you to design a website and make it look nice.

When wanting to access a specific area use a selector
> p{
  font-family: Arial;
}

The P is the selector and the font-family is the declaration. 

When using internal CSS you can use CSS in html by using style in tags.

A universal selector is *()
A type selector would be like h1, h2 or h3.
A class slector would be .code the name of whatever
A ID selector would be accessed by the #.
A Child selector would be li>a.
