## Text

The head has 6 levels and the higher in number the headers go the smaller the words become.

A paragraph is enclosed by <p> This would be a paragraph inside of these tags.<p>

To bold a word simply use **<b>Word</b>**

To italicize a word simple use ***<i>Word</i>***

Visual editors can be used to help get a presenataion of how ones code can look.

<strong> between words means the word/ sentence has a meaning and will be bold </strong>

To quote cite something using a web link you can use the following 
<blockquote cite="LINK">
<P> The food was tasty and I didn't wanna stop eating.</p>
</blockquote>

To quote something without using the "" you can use <q> </q> tags.

To abbrivate an accronym you can use <acronym title="Fast Pizza Place"> Pizza</acronym>

The <s> </s> will let you mark a line through information that is not longer valid but you would still like to keep because it may have an importance in the future.
