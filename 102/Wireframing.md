# Structuring Web Pages with HTML (CODE 102 Read 04)

**Wireframe**: A common practice used by UX designers to plan a information class for a website e.t.c. A sketch of a design for a website e.t.c.

Two types of wireframes:
Hand Drawn Wireframe
Digital Wireframe

**Wireframing**: Is used either by drwaing by hand or other apps or tools designed.

Some of the best tools for wireframing are UXPins, InVision and Wireframe.cc

The three key principles for a good wireframe are Clarity, confidence and simplicity. 

**HTML**: Is a markup language that defines the  stucture of your content.

This is how you start a paragraph "< P >" without the spaces.
And to end a paragraph you use < /p >  without the spaces.

Nesting in **HTML** is the best way to make something bold.

Example: < P > The cat is very < strong > mad </ strong > at times < /p > without the spaces in between the <>.

Inserting Images in HTML can be done with this code                                                       < img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" > without the spacing inside.

Headings in HTML can be used like < h1 > Hello < /h1 > withouth the spacing also. This goes as follows all the way up to 6.

Inserting a link would go as follows < a href="https://example.com">Website< /a > without any of the spaces included into the synyax.

**Semantics** is the meaning of the code and what it does rather than what it'll look like.

Create A HTML website:

Create a Repository

Open terminal change to a free file

git clone "insert link"

Put in code . to open vscode and edit

Go back to termina and type in **touch index.html**
Once website is ready deploy by going to pages and changing source to main, click the link address and input it into the main area of the repositories.

First thing needed in vs code needs to be  <! DOCTYPE html > without the spaces.
Following < html >   < /html > needs to be added  
Following that you need a < head >  < /head > you need to insert < title > < /title > inside of the head.
Right below the head you can open up a body tag < bodt > </ body >
Inside the body you can add < Header > </ heaeder >
Inside the body you can add < main > < / main >
Inside the body you can add < Footer > < /Footer >
Styling on a website usually is CSS to make it look nice.
