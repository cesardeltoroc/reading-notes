Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm <!-- rob-bell.net -!>

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set. <!-- rob-bell.net -!>

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. <!-- rob-bell.net -!>

O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. <!-- rob-bell.net -!>

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. <!-- rob-bell.net -!>

So basically the Big O notation is a way we can tell how long an algorithm is going to take to run. Also a large collection of data.

# Pain v Suffering

What’s your perspective?
 - My perspective on this is to bring my own twist to development. I dont't have much of a social lifestyle so I wanna implement ways I could be social in my software and other ways.

Why are you doing this?
 - Im doing this class to get myself a career in something I have always had a passion for, but now I am able to.

Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
- This is one of the only things that keep me going along this journey knowing that one day I will be able to become a full time software developer.

Are you doing this for you?
- I am doing this for myself, but also others. I wanna become a developer who can build applications for all users with different background in tech.
