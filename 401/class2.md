> What are three expected benefits of testing

- significant reductions in defect rates
- veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality
- that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases

> Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

## CI/CD

> What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

## Things I want to know more about

> Where will CI/CD be implemented in this class. Will we have to do a project inculding this kinda of evelopment.
