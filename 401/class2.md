Recursion: Calling a function from itself, Sometimes may be infinite so make sure you have proper code to prevent this problem.

sys.setrecursionlimit(<enter limit>)
 > This will set a limit on the how many times you use a Recursion.

    if __name__ == “__main__”:
 > __name__ prints out as __main__

 > When you run a file it usually compiles from the main.py file, to prevernt this you can also define a FUNCTION in the main.py file and call the function only if ___ main ___ == "__ name __".

 > This first module name is usually called main so the value for name in main.py is __main__.

 > If you want to import a different name of another file import it into main.py to show the name of the file on the other page.

 ## Things I want to know more about
