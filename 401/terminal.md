# Command Line
> The command line is simply a tool used to types commands on your keyboard.
> 
> Its interesting to know the terminal has something known as the shell which looks 
at the executing code for you.

> At the very top of the structure of data you have the root directory, which is denoted by a slash (/).

> Absolute paths begin with (/), while relative paths do not begin with (/) but will specify a file location. 

> ls can show the files located within a directory and ls -a can show all of the hidden files within that directory (./hidenl-file).

> man [command] can be used to see more information on the hierarchy of what command you are using.

## File Manipulation

> Creating a directort [mkdir (name)]

> Removing a directory [rmdir (name)]

> Creating a blank file is [touch (file name)]

> Copying a file is [cp (source, destination)]
