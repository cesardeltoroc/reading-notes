> What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- Well I am no a special person so there is nothing that I can bring that any other software engineer couldn't possibly bring. But I can bring an effort to intergrate into a community and devlop within. I have a strong willinginess to prove myself when given the chance and will always take advantage to do so whether it be helping myself or others throughout my career. 


> What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Take a break away from the computer when needed.
- ASK, ASK, ASK For help I need to shy away from being afraid to ask questions and just ask. Sometimes I feel as if they questions I should already know but I second guess myself and confuse myself so just simply asking can fix my problems.
- GOOGLE.COM use stackoverflow, cross code from previous projects I've done.
