# Dynamic webpages with JavaScrit [CODE 102 Read 06]
Java allows you to implement complex functions into a webpage.

Java is case sensitive so some words might be able to be reused if a certain letter isnt properly capitalized or lowercased.

Declarations in Java Script are
var = Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
let = Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
const = Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

Variable's can be used as a symbolic name for your values in your application.

These are all considered Java Script Identifies (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0â€“9).

You can also let variables unpack values from other object literals using the destructing assignment.
EXAMPLE: git {food} = me
This will create a variable "food" and assign it to "me"

The **let** statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

**Constants** are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword.

Primitive in Java Script is data that is not an object and has no methods.
**Boolean**. true and false.
**null**. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
**undefined**. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
**Number**. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
**BigInt**. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
**String**. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
**Symbol** (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.

The + in Java Script converts the umeric values to strings.

This is an example of an **Array Literal**
literal let fish = ['Lion', , 'Angel'];
fish [0] is 'Lion'
fish [1] is undefined
fish [2] is 'Angel'

The **Boolean** has two litearl values true and false.

**Numeric Literals** Integer litearls in different bases as well as floating-point literals in base-10.

**Big Int** Integer and BigInt literals can be written in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8) and binary (base 2).

**Floating point Literal** can have the following
-An unsigned decimal integer
-A decimal point (".")
-A fraction (Another decimal number)
-Lastly, an exponnent.

You can declare a variable by making this a variable (userAge) and making a prompt ('What is your Age?').

document.write is a built in javascript code and used to put it into a website from vscode.

You can use alert inside of a  if command to inform someone something.
