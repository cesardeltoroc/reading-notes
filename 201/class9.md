## List, Tables, And Forms
list-style-position allows you to change the style of the list you created in html in CSS.

Empty cells in tables can be hidden using the following in CSS.
>table.one {
  empty.cells:hide;
}

### Events

Tradition DOM event handlers example
>element.onevent = functionName;

 element.event =     code

There are HTML 5 events, Mutation events & observors, Keyboard events, Mouse events, Focus and Blur events, User Interface events.

You can also use event delegation.

An event is an asynchronous code that runs out of order.

Event bubbling is allowing you to use event listener to listen to a specific element in different elements.

.addEventListener will listen to two parameters such as "click" or handle click.
