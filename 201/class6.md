Values can be strings, numbers, booleans and array's.

> var hotel = {
name: 'jr',
rooms: 100,
booked: 54,



> checkAvalibility: function() {
  return this.rooms - this.booked;
}
}

### Document object literal 

getElementId selects an individual element given the value of it's attribute. <!-- Javascript & JQUERY Jon Duckett -->

Selecting elements with an ID attribute. In javascript you would need to assign a new variable to equal the ID by document.using getElemendId.

There are perviousSibling, nextSibling, firstChild and lastChild.

perviousSibling and nextSibling access the ones behind it and after it but not the one it's using as a refernce.

The firstChild and lastChild access the first and last child in the element usually by accessing the block.

The html DOM defines all of the elements inside as objects
