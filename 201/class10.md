## Debugging

Order of execution can cause problems in code because sometimes certain codes need to be ran in order for its sibling codes tor run.

Javascript stacks fuctions on top of new task.

Scoped variables are placed inside of a function and connot be accessed globally unless called upon using something to access it from that function.

Error objects can help you find your mistakes because it shows the type or error and the line where the problem occured in the console when using a webpage.

Reference errors are common when a variable is not declared globaly and it's scoped inside of another function. 

TypeErrors are commonly caused by trying to use an object or method that does not exist. <!-- JavaScript & JQUERY  Jon Duckett>

Range Error is when you call a function using numbers outside of its accepted range. <!-- JavaScript & JQUERY  Jon Duckett>

NaN Better than nothing it can show that maybe something got inserted somewhere and it wasnt placed as a number.

Debugging Workflow:
> Find the are where the code seems to be running into a problem.
> Read the message from the console.
> Checkt how far the code runs.
> Use breakpoints where the code goes wrong so you can inspect the values that are stored in variables.<!-- JavaScript & JQUERY  Jon Duckett>
>Check the numbers and string and make sure where they are going can be inserted as written.

You can use the keyword Debugger in a spot where the code seems to be having problems so you can fix the code.
