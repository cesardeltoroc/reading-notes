## Introduction
My name is Cesar Deltoro I'm a veteran and am looking to start my career in tech. I have always had a passion for tech since before I joined the Army and now that I am no longer serving I have been given the chance to start my dream career in tech. Im located in TN and am relocating to WA soon and can't wait to start meeting everyone in this class and growing friendships.

### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset allows an indivudual to grow and possibly be in a better mood overall. Growth mindsets give more space for growth rather than a fixed mindset keeping you boxed in a norm. 

* Think about why you are doing this what made you wanna start a career in tech in the first place.
* Remind yourself that you can be part of a team and work with others if you ever get caught in a struggle.
* Maintain a healthy pattern and make sure you are also focusing on your mental health throughout the process.
