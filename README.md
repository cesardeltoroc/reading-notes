### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset allows an indivudual to grow and possibly be in a better mood overall. Growth mindsets give more space for growth rather than a fixed mindset keeping you boxed in a norm. 

1. Think about why you are doing this what made you wanna start a career in tech in the first place.
2. Remind yourself that you can be part of a team and work with others if you ever get caught in a struggle.
3. Maintain a healthy pattern and make sure you are also focusing on your mental health throughout the process.
